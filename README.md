### Analysis of all the places of our stay in Yerevan for a month and a half after relocation from the Russian Federation

We left at the beginning of June 2022 due to the start of an aggressive war against fraternal Ukraine and fascism in the minds of people in our country

I decided to collect in one consolidated dashboard all the places where we managed to live in Yerevan during this period

               Analysis and visualization is displayed in two tools - Tableau & Microsoft Power BI

There are 3 types of data visualization:
- A map of the city with the location of places of stay and color separation by districts of Yerevan, the value of the mark shows the number of days spent
- Donut chart to show the distribution of days of stay by place and area
- Summary table of all places with the name of locations, their types and districts

##### Tools used: Oracle SQL, PL/SQL developer and Tableau
